# Hi there, I'm Utkrisht Verma 👋

## About Me

- 📍 Based in India (yes, where the Wi-Fi is as unpredictable as the Mumbai rains)
- 🧑‍💻 Data Scientist by day, Web App Developer by night, Machine Learning enthusiast 24/7
- ☕ Runs on chai, pandas, and the occasional stack overflow
- 🛠️ Currently building web apps that make data dance and models that (sometimes) behave
- 🤖 Fluent in Python, JavaScript, and sarcasm

## What I Do

- **Machine Learning:**  
  Training models to predict everything except when my code will work on the first try

- **Data Science:**  
  From wrangling messy datasets to visualizing insights—if it's data, I'm interested

- **Web App Development:**  
  Making data science accessible (and occasionally beautiful) through clean, interactive web apps

---

## My Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, SQL
- **Frameworks:** Flask, FastAPI, React, Django
- **ML Libraries:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, XGBoost
- **Data Tools:** pandas, NumPy, Jupyter
- **Data Viz:** matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly, D3.js
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- **Cloud:** AWS, GCP, Azure
- **Others:** Docker, Git, Linux

## Some Projects I'm ( thinking to build that I might be ) Proud Of ( in my thaughts ) 

### 🍵 Chai Predictor
A machine learning model that predicts your ideal chai recipe based on weather, mood, and coding stress levels. Because every data scientist needs a backup plan.
- **Tech:** Python, Flask, scikit-learn
- **Status:** 94% accuracy (the 6% accounts for personal preference and masala variations)

### 💰 Budget Bytes
A web app that tells you how much you _should_ be spending on samosas versus how much you actually are. Features guilt-inducing charts and motivational quotes about financial responsibility.
- **Tech:** React, Node.js, MongoDB
- **Status:** Successfully helped me realize I spend more on food delivery than my monthly internet bill

### 🏏 CodeCricket
Cricket analytics dashboard that provides deeper insights into player performance than most commentators. Because if you can't play like Kohli, you can at least analyze like a pro.
- **Tech:** Python, Streamlit, PostgreSQL
- **Status:** Predicted the last match outcome better than my cricket-expert uncle

## Current Learning Quest

- 🧠 Diving deeper into Large Language Models (because who doesn't want to chat with their code?)
- 🚀 Exploring MLOps (making my models production-ready, one pipeline at a time)
- 🔍 Computer Vision (teaching machines to see better than me without my glasses)
- ⚡ Optimizing web app performance (because users have the patience of a Mumbai auto driver)

---

## Fun Facts

- My code has more comments than lines (mostly apologies to my future self)
- I believe every good model deserves a second chance—and a third, and a fourth...
- I once explained deep learning to my grandmother. She now thinks I work for Google.
- My debugging process involves 20% actual debugging and 80% staring at the screen wondering why it worked yesterday
- I can convert coffee/chai consumption into productivity metrics with 95% confidence intervals

_Thanks for scrolling! If you made it this far, you deserve a cup of chai._ ☕

_P.S. If any of my projects actually work on your machine, please let me know. I'm collecting evidence._
